				<h1>Smile and Reduce Stress</h1>
				<p>Chronic stress does affect our outlook but it works the other way around as well. When we are smiling or we are
				happy, we producing happy hormones. While all students had high blood pressure and pumping hearts as a result of stress, those who had a 
				more positive outlook recovered much more quickly than those who were not. So even if stress is inevitable in 
				some situations paying attention to happiness in other areas of your life may help you to ride out the storm.</p>
